# Why Apprenticeship ? 🤔

Inspired by an 8th light [blog post.](https://8thlight.com/blog/lihsuan-lung/2012/02/13/why-apprenticeship.html) 

We live in a world where we are all learn differently, so why do we try to teach everyone the same way ? 

Modern education systems teach us all the same way, one teacher infront of a class of students reciting material from a textbook expecting us all of get the just of it so we can then go home to learn it all again by ourselves. 

With consideration to the difficulty of assigning each student their own teacher, this model of learning and knowledge transfer has shown its flaws. 

We have an opportuntity to change that in our organisations by adopting a more one-on-one model of learning through apprenticeships. Given the transition students make from universities to the workforce our organisations can find people with the passion to learn and put them on a track for success with dedicated mentors and a structured learning path fueled with hands on activities and team envolvement.

Giving apprentices the opportunity to work along side an experienced craftsperson who is continually improving and adding value to the organisation also helps the apprentice learn more about the non techical aspects of the software industry. 

By making this learning process more adaptive to individuals we start making learning an intentional part of our culture and as a by product our organisations organically start having the best people we need to succeed and move faster.
