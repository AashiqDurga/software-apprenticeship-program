# TDD (Test Driven Development)
Kent Beck is credited with having developed the concept of TDD. Test driven development is related to the test-first programming concepts of extreme programming.

The TDD development cycle
- Write a failing test (red)
- Write production code to make the test pass (green)
- Refactor
- Repeat

### Principles
- Test first
- Fail fast
- Always refactor (your tests are code to so think about them when you reach this step)

### The rules of TDD
1. You are not allowed to write any production code unless it is to make a failing unit test pass.
2. You are not allowed to write any more of a unit test than is sufficient to fail; and compilation failures are failures.
3. You are not allowed to write any more production code than is sufficient to pass the one failing unit test.
