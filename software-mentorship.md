# Software Mentorship

We very soon in our careers learn that university preps us for academic life and doesn't really teach us what it is like in the real world.

 This is very relevant in the software industry. In a world of rapidly evolving technology, we have to keep learning and moving forward in the most effective way to grow rapidly, gain real-world knowledge and try to not waste to much time making silly mistakes.

 This is were mentorship plays a vital role. Adopting a culture of mentorship in our organisations allow us to create a stream of knowledge flow from those who have fought many battles to those just entering the arena.
