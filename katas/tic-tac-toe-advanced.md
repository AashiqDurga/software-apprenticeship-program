# Tic Tac Toe Kata Advanced

There are a number of possible customizations to advanced Tic Tac Toe. Once you have completed the [Basic Tic Tac Toe](tic-tac-toe.md) do one or more of the following:

### More User Friendly Tic Tac Toe

Allows users to customize their game.

* Allow players to pick their markers (standard is X and O)  
* Allow players to decide who goes first  
* Allow games to be saved and resumed later  
* Allow users to be able to play as many rounds as they want without having to restart the application.  

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Any size Tic Tac Toe

Refactor your TTT to allow it to work on any size grid. 

#### Constraints

* At the beginning of a game you should be able to determine what sized board you want to play - it should default to on a 3x3 but any size is doable up to a 10x10.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 3D Tic Tac Toe

Refactor your TTT to allow work in a 3D grid  

#### Constraints

* At the beginning of a game you should be able to determine what sized board you want to play - it should default to on a 3x3 but any size is doable up to a 10x10.


------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Bad Computer Tic Tac Toe

Implement a computer player for the game that is really bad.

#### Constraints  

* The computer player can pic a random position on the board each time but shouldn't pick a spot that has already been taken.  
* The human player will always be represented by “O”, while the computer player will be represented by 'X'.  

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Change the Interface Tic Tac Toe

If the initial TTT had only one user interface (i.e., command line), write a version of TTT that supports two interfaces (i.e., command line and web application).  

Make sure that one interface is event-driven (i.e., web) and another is loop-driven (i.e., command line).   

This becomes the perfect opportunity to teach about abstraction of a view layer and "Tell Don't Ask."  

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Good Computer Tic Tac Toe

Implement a computer player for the game that is really good. The computer player should never loose and will win where possible.
